---- this file needs updating for version 0.10 ! ------

--
-- it is meant to be an easily extensibly smtpd engine.

Problems:
  First thing to do is to watch the log carefully.  If it doesn't
  help you, or even if it does, please post to the maliinglist
  (subscription instructions above).  qpsmtpd is meant to be a drop-in 
  replacement for qmail-smtpd, so it should be very easy to get going.


Configuration files:
  All configuration files goes into $DIR/config/ or /var/qmail/control/

  qpsmtpd is supposed to support all the files that qmail-smtpd
  supports and use them in the same way.  When you find that it is not
  the case, feel free to send a patch to the mailinglist or to
  ask@develooper.com.

  Extra files you can use to configure qpsmtpd:

     rhsbl_zones
 
        Right hand side blocking lists, one per line. For example:

           dsn.rfc-ignorant.org does not accept bounces - http://www.rfc-ignorant.org/

        See http://www.rfc-ignorant.org/ for more examples.


     dnsbl_zones

        Normal ip based dns blocking lists ("RBLs"). For example:

           relays.ordb.org
	   spamsources.fabel.dk


     require_resolvable_fromhost
         
        If this file contains anything but a 0 on the first line,
        envelope senders will be checked against DNS. If an A or a MX
        record can't be found the mail command will return a soft
        rejection (450).
