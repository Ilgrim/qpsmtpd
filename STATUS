things to do for v0.10
----------------------

transaction should maybe be a part of the connection object instead
of off the main object

get timeouts to work in "tcpserver" mode (or generally; not sure where
it fits best)


plugin support;

  support plugins for the rest of the commands.

  specify a priority in register_hook. ("LAST", "FIRST", "MIDDLE", or
  maybe a number)

  proper access to the message body through the transaction


data command
  
  how to spool message to a file when it grows large and still give
  reasonable easy access to the data from plugins?

... 


TRACE in Constants.pm is not actually being used.  Should it?



Future Ideas
============

Methods to create a bounce message easily; partly so we can accept a
mail for one user but bounce it right away for another RCPT'er.

David Carraway has some thoughts for "user filters"
